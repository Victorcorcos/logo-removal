Automatically detect and remove artist watermarks/logos from images using AI-based object detection and inpainting. This tool provides a completely hands-free, scalable solution for batch processing images.

## 🎁 Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Uses YOLOv11 to automatically locate logos/watermarks on images
- **AI-Powered Removal**: Uses IOPaint with MAT or LaMa models for seamless logo removal
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire folders of images automatically
- **GPU Acceleration**: Supports CUDA for faster processing (falls back to CPU if unavailable)
- **Preserves Quality**: Maintains original image dimensions, format, and quality
- **Offline & Free**: Uses open-source models, no API keys or internet required (after setup)
- **Smart Masking**: Automatically expands detection regions for complete logo coverage

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux (tested on Linux Mint), macOS, or Windows
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Storage**: ~500MB for models
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- **GPU** (Optional): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster processing

## 👣 Setup

### 1. Clone or Download This Repository

```rb
cd /path/to/your/repositories
git clone git@github.com:Victorcorcos/logo-removal.git
cd logo-removal
```

Or simply download and extract the files to a folder.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment & Activate it (Recommended)

```rb
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```rb
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For GPU Support (NVIDIA CUDA):**

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want faster processing → PyTorch with CUDA support:

```rb
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### 4. Download the YOLO Model

Run the setup script to download the pre-trained logo detection model:

```rb
python scripts/setup_models.py
```

This will download the YOLOv11 model (~250MB) to the `models/` directory.

**Alternative Manual Download:**

If the script fails, you can manually download the model:

1. Visit: https://huggingface.co/corzent/yolo11x_watermark_detection
2. Download `best.pt`
3. Create a `models/` directory in the project folder
4. Place the downloaded file in `models/best.pt`

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic

Process all images in a folder:

```rb
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images/with/logos
```

This will:
- Scan `/path/to/images/with/logos` for images
- Detect and remove logos from each image
- Save results to `/path/to/images/with/logos/cleaned/`

### Advanced

```rb
# Enable verbose logging
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images -v

# Specify custom output directory
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/input -o /path/to/output

# Use a custom YOLO model
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images -m /path/to/custom_model.pt

# Adjust detection confidence threshold (0-1)
# Lower = more detections (may include false positives)
# Higher = fewer detections (may miss some logos)
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images -c 0.5

# Adjust mask expansion (pixels to expand around detected logo)
# Increase if logo edges are still visible after removal
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images -e 20

# Choose inpainting model (mat or lama)
# MAT: Better for large masks and anime images (default)
# LaMa: Better for photographic images
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images --inpaint-model lama

# Force CPU usage (disable GPU)
python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images -d cpu
```

| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose logging | `False` |

### Workflow

```rb
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Process images
python remove_logos.py -i ~/Pictures/anime_images

# 3. Check the results
ls ~/Pictures/anime_images/cleaned/

# 4. View the log for any issues
cat log/logo_removal.log
```

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **Detection Phase**
   - YOLOv11 scans each image to locate logos/watermarks
   - Returns bounding box coordinates for each detected logo

2. **Masking Phase**
   - Creates a binary mask for each detected logo region
   - Expands the mask by 15 pixels (configurable) to ensure complete coverage
   - White pixels (255) indicate areas to remove, black (0) is preserved

3. **Inpainting Phase**
   - IOPaint inpainting model (MAT or LaMa) analyzes the surrounding context
   - Intelligently fills in the masked region
   - Seamlessly blends the inpainted area with the original image

4. **Output**
   - Saves the processed image with the same filename
   - Maintains original format, dimensions, and quality
   - Skips already processed files

## 🎨 Supported Image Formats

- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- BMP
- TIFF
- WebP

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Use GPU**: Processing is 5-10x faster with CUDA-enabled GPU
2. **Batch Size**: Process large folders in chunks if memory is limited
3. **Mask Expansion**: Start with default (15px), increase if logo remnants remain
4. **Confidence Threshold**: Lower for subtle logos, raise to reduce false detections

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No logos detected

- **Increase confidence threshold**: Try `-c 0.15` for more sensitive detection
- **Check image quality**: Very low resolution images may not detect well
- **Logo type**: The model is trained on common watermark styles; unusual logos may not be detected

### Logo not fully removed

- **Increase mask expansion**: Try `-e 20` or `-e 25`
- **Check detection**: Use verbose mode `-v` to see if logo was detected correctly

### Out of memory errors

- **Force CPU**: Use `-d cpu` (slower but uses less memory)
- **Process fewer images**: Split large folders into smaller batches
- **Close other applications**: Free up RAM before processing

### Model download fails

- **Manual download**: Follow the alternative download instructions above
- **Check internet**: Ensure stable connection to Hugging Face
- **Firewall**: Check if downloads from huggingface.co are blocked

### Poor inpainting quality

- Try switching inpainting models:
  - **MAT** (default): Better for anime/stylized images and large masks
  - **LaMa**: Better for photographic/realistic images
  - Example: `python remove_logos.py -i /path/to/images --inpaint-model lama`
- Inpainting works best when:
  - The logo is on a relatively uniform background
  - The logo doesn't cover critical details
  - The surrounding context provides clear patterns to continue

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Fully Offline**: After initial model download, no internet required
- **No Telemetry**: No data is sent anywhere
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens on your machine
